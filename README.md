I completed Kirk's free "Learning Python" course for network engineers and decided to backup the cisco switches configurations in my environment. Netmiko is powerful, flexible and has been a ton of fun to learn and use.

Sample of backup output:

While working through the email course, I came across https://www.nocturnaltechies.com/post/python-and-netmiko-automate-configuration-backup and have used quite a bit of this code. I really like the format of the error output as well as how it automates creating a new folder / filename!
