# netmikolab
using netmiko to manage network device configuration


This project began after coming across https://www.nocturnaltechies.com/post/python-and-netmiko-automate-configuration-backup/

My goal with this project is to manage the configuration of my lab network devices, including performing backups and pushing updates.
