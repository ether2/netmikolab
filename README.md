Netmiko is an open-source Python library developed by Kirk Byers, based on Paramiko SSH Library.

I completed Kirk's free "Learning Python" course for network engineers and decided to backup the cisco switches configurations in my environment. Netmiko is powerful, flexible and has been a ton of fun to learn and use.

Sample of backup output:
