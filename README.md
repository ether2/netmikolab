# netmikolab
using netmiko to manage network device configuration


After beginning Kirk Byers Python course, I was reading up on Netmiko and came across: https://www.nocturnaltechies.com/post/python-and-netmiko-automate-configuration-backup/ 

This was the starting point of this project, and my goalhere is to manage the configuration of lab network devices, including performing backups and pushing updates.

Backup works!:
